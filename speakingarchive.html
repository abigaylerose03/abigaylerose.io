        <h3 style="color: gray; overflow-x: scroll"><i>Abigayle was the most inspiring, helpful, knowledgeable, and patient mentor. Through that short one hour, she generously offered me guidance and expert advice from her extensive experience as the entrepenuer of an international non-profit, from navigating high school to jump-starting my cs career to launching my organization, and everything in between. She was quick to lend her help, answer my questions, and a truly passionate worker and leader for social impact. She was such an amazing, caring, open person to talk to and beyond the valuable help she gave me, we had such a memorable conversation and her story is inspiring for me as a role model, and other girls likewise who are pursuing STEM endeavours.</i></h3>
