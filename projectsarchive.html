                <p>I coded and published from the ground up to the Apple/GooglePlay Store a mental health app called Magnify Wellness. The mission is to ensure everyone has the ability to find quality, affordable mental health support. My qualtiative user research stated that 54% of youth (ages 15-19) do not know where and how to locate mental health support, and 45% have felt an increased sense of loneliness during Januar-March 2020, indictive of the pandemic. I synthesized my user research to create the app, and later founded 501 (c)(3) nonprofit to expand the app's positive impact. As <strong>founder and Executive Director</strong>, I managed 12+ teams in their day to day operations, launched partnerships with other mental health orgs, secured $100k+ in funding (Top 6 world finalists Global Health Innovations from Bay Area competition), and oversaw the completion of our other community initiatives. Our global impact includes <strong>100k+</strong> youth reached, <strong>4k+</strong> app downloads, <strong>2k+</strong> wellness resources on our online database, and <strong>70+</strong> established chapter clubs with free school binders sent.
