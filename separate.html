                             As an IOS app engineer, I successfully programmed a dental tracking app for a community dental hygienist, Erin Pocius. Currently, the software is utilized for her local business. By utilizing JavaScriptâ€™s library React Native for IOS and Android app development, the app allows the filling of various dental forms, patient info, connection between insurance companies, and database management.
