        <h3 id="about-me-subtitle" class="light">Rebuilding digital communities with empathy and grit</h3>
        <p class="light-white" id="about-me-para">Abigayle Peterson is a 20-year-old innovator,<br> social entrepreneur, community builder,<br> and founder of Magnify Wellness, an AI-powered mental health app she programmed,<br> backed by Stanford Medicine research. In the year of 2016,  Abigayle became a victim to<br> extreme offline and online harassment <br>after transitioning from homeschool to public education. She then moved to <br>Big Island, Hawai‚Äôi in her sophomore year of high school <br>where she entered the world of entrepreneurship for the very time.<br> As one of only 20 high school students selected for the prestigious Nalukai Startup Academy, <br>she learned about crafting an MVP, pitching to investors, storytelling, and digital marketing. <br>She met genuine friends who taught her the importance of resilience and having a community of shared life experience. <br>She even was introduced to the creators of Tetris!<br> The shared experiences of loss and loneliness acted as her North Star to develop digital spaces<br> that include everyone. As a result of newfound <br>friendships and knowledge from engineers at Apple, GitHub, Sequoia Capital, etc.<br> Abigayle created the technology product Magnify Wellness, <br>which acts as the go-to hub of mental health resources and stress-relief tools. She discovered <br>that her 1000+ app users have felt 100% ‚Äúmore encouraged and less lonely‚Äù after using the app.
            <br>

        <br>For her public service, advocacy, and her commitment to helping leading the tech for social good movement, <br>she has been named a 2020 Grace Hopper Scholar,<br> National Center of Women in Technology National Finalist, 2020 STEM House Nonprofit Scholar,<br> Wonder Women in Tech Innovator Scholar, Rising Star in STEM Finalist by Reinvenetd Inc, and much more.
        <br>

        <br>Abigayle has helped spark a movement that prioritizes their mental health<br> and creates technology for good. To date, she has been featured on 30+ publications and conferences<br>as a speaker such as Channel Kindness, <br>VoyageDallas Magazine, TechTogether, AIHacks, <br>and much more where she shares her personal testimony. <br>
        Outside of Magnify Wellness, she is involved on her college campus as an Officer at the Association of Computing Machinery, <br>AI researcher, and multiple small Christian youth groups. 
        <br><br>Abigayle is currently pursuing her undergraduate education at Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA.
